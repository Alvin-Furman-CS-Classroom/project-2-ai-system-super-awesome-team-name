**Module plan:**

| Module | Required Topic(s)                                   |Topic Covered By| Checkpoint Due       |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------| ---------------| ---------------------|
| 1      | Knowledge Representation, Knowledge Bases           | Week 2         | Checkpoint 1 (Feb 11)|
| 2      | Propositional Logic, Knowledge Bases, Inference     | Week 3         | Checkpoint 2 (Feb 26)|
| 3      | First-Order Logic                                   | Week 4         | Checkpoint 3 (Mar 19)|
| 4      | Search (Uniform Cost, A\*)                          | Week 5         | Checkpoint 4 (Apr 2) |
| 5      | Reinforcement Learning (Policy Learning, Q-Learning)| Week 8-9       | Checkpoint 5 (Apr 16)|

## Constraints

- 5 modules total, each tied to course topics.
- Each module must have clear inputs/outputs and tests.
- Align module timing with the course schedule.

## How the Agent Should Help

- Draft plans for each module before coding.
- Suggest clean architecture and module boundaries.
- Identify missing tests and edge cases.
- Review work against the rubric using the code-review skill.

## Agent Workflow

1. Ask for the current module spec from `README.md`.
2. Produce a plan (use "Plan" mode if available).
3. Wait for approval before writing or editing code.
4. After implementation, run the code-review skill and list gaps.
