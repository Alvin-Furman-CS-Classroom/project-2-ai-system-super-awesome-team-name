[Your Module Plan Table copied from README.md]

## Constraints

- 5-6 modules total, each tied to course topics.
- Each module must have clear inputs/outputs and tests.
- Align module timing with the course schedule.

## How the Agent Should Help

- Draft plans for each module before coding.
- Suggest clean architecture and module boundaries.
- Identify missing tests and edge cases.
- Review work against the rubric using the code-review skill.

## Agent Workflow

1. Ask for the current module spec from `README.md`.
2. Produce a plan (use "Plan" mode if available).
3. Wait for approval before writing or editing code.
4. After implementation, run the code-review skill and list gaps.
